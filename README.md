# WebServer

Repository to hold my website, ideally hosted on the andrewbarkley.co.uk domain. This web server is written in GoLang on the back end, leveraging the GopherJS library to transpile Go code seamlessly into JavaScript, allowing me to reduce cognitive dissonance as the front/back end components will be homogeneous.
