# WebServer

Repository to hold the website created to house my portfolio, ideally on the owned domain andrewbarkley.co.uk. This web server is written in GoLang on the back end, leveraging the GopherJS library to transpile Go code seamlessly into JavaScript, allowing me to reduce cognitive dissonance as the front/back end components will be homogeneous.
